Yooo!!! My name is Blark, I’m a professional drummer pursuing a PhD in high-tech for fun! Just kidding :smile: :smile: :smile:! Anyway, I’m a fourth-year PhD student from UCSD, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. I got my master’s degree from UCSD ECE department in March. 2021, with a specialization in Signal & Image Processing, and continued to my PhD in UCSD Video Processing Lab under supervision of Prof. Truong Nguyen. I started a long-term cooperation with Qualcomm R&D XR/CV team from 2021 summer as a Deep Learning Researcher intern.

My research focus on Computer Vision & Graphics, specifically on very important areas including the cross-cutting area of 2D/3D vision, understanding, and learning strategies, where my research benefits a wide range of industrial applications such as Robotics, Autonomous Driving, XR/VR. In Qualcomm, I work on many SOTA problems including 3D body/hand modeling & tracking, 3D scene reconstruction, understanding & reasoning.

Music is my life!!! I started professional percussion training at 4 years old in "Central Conservation of Music"(CCOM) - No.1 musical institute in China. I passed the highest professional certificate in CCOM for "snare drum" when I was 9 and spent 5 years in the No.1 youth symphonic orchestra in Beijing, from 7-12 years old. I will be serving in percussion part in UCSD Symphonic Orchestra from Jan. 2023. I am also actively seeking partners to form a band, and I am into metal/hard rock, blues, jazz! Pin me if you want a band! Let’s Rock California!!!
